## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learned how to properly use flexbox, for this example i used display:flex on body element. At the start i had problems using flexbox, becouse i used it on wrong html class, later fixed it.
Hardest part was ofcourse learning to use flexbox, but after couple unsuccessful attempts learned my way thrue using flexbox.
