## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learned how to properly use Flexbox; for this example, I used display:flex on the body element. At the start, I had problems using Flexbox because I used it on the wrong HTML class. Later, I fixed it. The hardest part was, of course, learning to use Flexbox, but after a couple unsuccessful attempts, I learned my way through using flexbox.
